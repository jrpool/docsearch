           Common Interest Developments: Association Governance: Elections

                                     <u> DESCRIPTION </u> 

          This bill authorizes a homeowner association in a residential  
          common interest development to declare an election of directors  
          "uncontested" when the number of candidates for election does  
          not exceed the number of directors to be elected.  This bill  
          also authorizes an aggrieved party to bring a cause of action  
          alleging a violation of specified election requirements in small  
          claims court.

                                     <u> BACKGROUND </u> 

          In California, common interest developments (CIDs) are governed  
          by the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act  
          ("Davis-Stirling Act" or "Act").  Owners of separate property in  
          CIDs have an undivided interest in the common property of the  
          development and are subject to the CID's covenants, conditions,  
          and restrictions.  CIDs are also governed by a homeowner  
          association, which is run by volunteer directors that may or may  
          not have prior experience managing an association.  The Court of  
          Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, previously observed that:

            [t]he homeowners associations function almost "as a second  
            municipal government, regulating many aspects of [the  
            homeowners'] daily lives."  "[U]pon analysis of the  
            association's functions, one clearly sees the association as  
            a quasi-government entity paralleling in almost every case  
            the powers, duties, and responsibilities of a municipal  








          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 2 of ? 


            government.  As a 'mini-government,' the association  
            provides to its members, in almost every case, utility  
            services, road maintenance, street and common area lighting,  
            and refuse removal.  In many cases, it also provides  
            security services and various forms of communication within  
            the community.  There is, moreover, a clear analogy to the  
            municipal police and public safety functions. . . ."  In  
            short, homeowners associations, via their enforcement of the  
            CC&amp;R's, provide many beneficial and desirable services that  
            permit a common interest development to flourish.  (Villa  
            Milano Homeowners Ass'n v. Il Davorge (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th  
            819, 836 [citations omitted].)

          Just as with municipal governments, homeowner associations use  
          elections to choose members to serve on an association's board  
          of directors and to levy assessments for particular purposes.   
          Under existing law, homeowner associations conduct elections  
          through a paper and mail based balloting system that resembles  
          California's vote by mail process.  While most CIDs in  
          California have less than 25 units, the expense of conducting  
          elections in larger associations -particularly those with  
          several thousand units - can be significant.

          This bill would permit the board of directors of an association  
          to determine that an election for replacement directors is  
          uncontested when the number of candidates standing for election,  
          including write-in candidates, does not exceed the number of  
          open seats on the board.

                               <u> CHANGES TO EXISTING LAW
          </u> 
          <u> Existing law </u> , the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development  
          Act, establishes the rules and regulations governing the  
          operation of a residential common interest development (CID) and  
          the respective rights and duties of a homeowners association and  
          its members.  (Civ. Code Sec. 4000 et seq.)

          <u> Existing law </u> requires association elections regarding  
          assessments legally requiring a vote, election and removal of  
          directors, amendments to the governing documents, or the grant  
          of exclusive use of common area to be held by secret ballot in  
          accordance with specified procedures.  (Civ. Code Sec. 5100.)

          <u> Existing law </u> authorizes associations to specify the  







          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 3 of ? 


          qualifications for candidates for the board and any other  
          elected position, and procedures for the nomination of  
          candidates, consistent with the governing documents.  (Civ. Code  
          Sec. 5105(a).)

          <u> Existing law </u> authorizes associations to specify the  
          qualifications for voting, the voting power of each membership,  
          the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies, and the  
          voting period for elections, including the times at which polls  
          will open and close, consistent with the governing documents.   
          (Civ. Code Sec. 5105(a).)

          <u> Existing law </u> authorizes associations to specify a method of  
          selecting one or three independent third parties as inspector or  
          inspectors of elections.  (Civ. Code Sec. 5105(a).)

          <u> Existing law</u> requires associations to select an independent  
          inspector or inspectors of elections to do the following:
           determine the number of memberships entitled to vote and the  
            voting power of each;
           determine the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies,  
            if any;
           receive ballots;
           hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way  
            arising out of or in connection with the right to vote;
           count and tabulate all votes;
           determine when the polls shall close, consistent with the  
            governing documents;
           determine the tabulated results of the election; and
           perform any acts as may be proper to conduct the election with  
            fairness to all members in accordance with all applicable laws  
            and rules of the association regarding the conduct of the  
            election.  (Civ. Code Sec. 5110(c).)

          <u> Existing law </u> specifies the voting procedure for an association  
          election as follows:
           Ballots and two preaddressed envelopes with instructions on  
            how to return ballots shall be mailed by first-class mail or  
            delivered by the association to every member not less than 30  
            days prior to the deadline for voting.  In order to preserve  
            confidentiality, a voter may not be identified by name,  
            address, lot, parcel, or unit number on the ballot.  The  
            association shall use as a model those procedures used by  
            California counties for ensuring confidentiality of vote by  







          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 4 of ? 


            mail ballots, including all of the following:
             o    the ballot itself is not signed by the voter, but is  
               inserted into an envelope that is sealed.  This envelope is  
               inserted into a second envelope that is sealed.  In the  
               upper left hand corner of the second envelope, the voter  
               shall sign the voter's name, indicate the voter's name, and  
               indicate the address or separate interest identifier that  
               entitles the voter to vote; and
             o    the second envelope is addressed to the inspector or  
               inspectors of elections, who will be tallying the votes.   
               The envelope may be mailed or delivered by hand to a  
               location specified by the inspector or inspectors of  
               elections.  The member may request a receipt for delivery.   
               (Civ. Code Sec. 5115(a).)

          <u> Existing law </u> states that a quorum shall be required only if so  
          stated in the governing documents or other provisions of law.   
          If a quorum is required by the governing documents, each ballot  
          received by the inspector of elections shall be treated as a  
          member present at a meeting for purposes of establishing a  
          quorum.  (Civ. Code Sec. 5115(a).)
          
          <u> Existing law </u> specifies that except for a meeting to count the  
          votes, an election may be conducted entirely by mail unless  
          otherwise specified in the governing documents.  (Civ. Code Sec.  
          5115(b).)

          <u> Existing law </u> provides that all votes shall be counted and  
          tabulated by the inspector or inspectors of elections in public  
          at a properly noticed open meeting of the board or members.  Any  
          candidate or other member of the association may witness the  
          counting and tabulation of the votes.  No person, including a  
          member of the association or an employee of the management  
          company, shall open or otherwise review any ballot prior to the  
          time and place at which the ballots are counted and tabulated.   
          The inspector of elections may verify the member's information  
          and signature on the outer envelope prior to the meeting at  
          which the ballots are tabulated.  Once a secret ballot is  
          received by the inspector of elections, it shall be irrevocable.  
           (Civ. Code Sec. 5120(a).)

          <u> Existing law </u> provides that the tabulated results of the election  
          shall be promptly reported to the board and shall be recorded in  
          the minutes of the next meeting of the board and shall be  







          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 5 of ? 


          available for review by members of the association.  (Civ. Code  
          Sec. 5120(b).)

          <u> Existing law </u> provides that the sealed ballots at all times shall  
          be in the custody of the inspector or inspectors of elections or  
          at a location designated by the inspector or inspectors until  
          after the tabulation of the vote, and until the time allowed for  
          challenging the election has expired, at which time custody  
          shall be transferred to the association.  If there is a recount  
          or other challenge to the election process, the inspector or  
          inspectors of elections shall, upon written request, make the  
          ballots available for inspection and review by an association  
          member or the member's authorized representative.  Any recount  
          shall be conducted in a manner that preserves the  
          confidentiality of the vote.  (Civ. Code Sec. 5125.)

          <u> This bill </u> provides that directors shall not be required to be  
          elected if the election is uncontested, and states that an  
          election of directors is uncontested if both the number of  
          candidates for election, including write-in candidates, does not  
          exceed the number of directors to be elected at that election,  
          and the association has declared the election is uncontested.

          <u> This bill </u> states that an association may declare an election of  
          directors to be uncontested only if all of the following  
          procedures have been satisfied:
           the association's adopted election rules have been complied  
            with;
           all declared candidates were nominated before the deadline for  
            nominations and in accordance with the association's governing  
            documents;
           the inspector of elections has informed the board that the  
            number of candidates does not exceed the number of directors  
            to be elected at that election;
           the board votes in open session to declare the election  
            uncontested after a hearing during an open board meeting where  
            members are able to make objections to the board making that  
            declaration; and
           at least 20 days before the board meeting for the vote to  
            declare an election uncontested, the association provides a  
            specified notice to all members.

          <u> This bill </u> states that the notice described above must set forth  
          the following:







          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 6 of ? 


           the intention of the board to vote at a regular board meeting  
            to declare the election of directors is uncontested, and  
            giving date, time, and place of that board meeting;
           a disclosure to members of the names of all candidates,  
            however nominated, including self-nomination, who will be  
            declared elected if the board declares the election is  
            uncontested; and
           the right of any member to appear at the board meeting and  
            make an objection to the board declaring the election is  
            uncontested before the board votes on the matter.

          <u> This bill </u> states that if the association's governing documents  
          provide for write-in votes on the ballot, the association shall  
          allow 15 days after the board meeting described above for a  
          write-in candidate to submit his or her name to the inspector of  
          elections.  In the event additional write-in candidates result  
          in the total number of candidates exceeding the number of  
          directors to be elected, an election shall be held.  If after  
          the 15-day period the total number of candidates, including the  
          number of write-in candidates, does not exceed the number of  
          directors to be elected, the uncontested election results shall  
          be sealed and become effective immediately, with any write-in  
          candidates added as members.

          <u> This bill </u> states that if an association's governing documents do  
          not provide for write-in votes on the ballot, then the  
          association must provide at least 15 days' general notice of a  
          self-nomination process.

          <u> This bill </u> requires an association's election rules to do the  
          following:
           ensure that an announcement of an election and notification of  
            nomination procedures, including self-nomination, shall be  
            provided to all members at least 60 days before any election  
            for directors;
           ensure a member who satisfies the lawful qualifications  
            adopted by the association is not denied the right to be a  
            candidate for director; and
           ensure a member who satisfies the lawful qualifications  
            adopted by the association is not denied the right to vote.

          <u> This bill </u> authorizes a cause of action alleging a violation of  
          these and other specified election requirements to be brought in  
          small claims court.

                                       <u> COMMENT
          </u> 
          <u> 1.Stated need for the bill </u> 

          The author writes:

            Often, homeowner association [HOA] board elections are  
            uncontested.  The number of candidates does not exceed the  
            number of vacant seats.  Current law requires such uncontested  
            elections to follow the same election procedures as contested  
            elections, including minimum vote thresholds and costly  
            third-party verification of results.  For instance, an  
            election for [an] HOA with 12,000 units could cost as much as  
            $20,000.  This unnecessarily burdens lower-income communities,  
            diverting resources from better uses.

            AB 1799 exempts homeowner associations from the costly  
            election procedure requirements in current law, when the  
            number of candidates does not exceed the number of open seats.  
             It includes a structured process, notice requirements, and  
            other safeguards.  Specifically, the bill:
                 Provides that an HOA board may declare an election  
               uncontested if the number of candidates does not exceed the  
               number of seats up for election.
                 Requires that an HOA board may only declare an election  
               uncontested in an open meeting, and only if it has complied  
               with all election rules.
                 Requires that notice be provided to homeowners before an  
               election is declared uncontested, which shall include their  
               right to object to that declaration.
                 For communities that allow write-in candidacies, allows  
               a fifteen day period after the election has been declared  
               uncontested for additional candidates to file. For  
               communities that do not, the bill requires that they allow  
               a period for self-nominations.
                 Ensures that members who satisfy the lawful  
               qualifications for voting or to serve as director are not  
               denied that right.

          <u> 1.Potential cost savings for homeowner associations </u> 

          The California Association of Community Managers (CACM) and the  
          Community Associations Institute (CAI), writing in support,  







          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 8 of ? 


          argue that this bill will potentially allow homeowner  
          associations to avoid the cost of conducting vote-by-mail  
          elections when the number of candidates standing for election  
          does not outnumber the number of open board seats.  CACM states:

            Elections of board members are an important part of how common  
            interest developments (CID) come together to build and  
            maintain healthy communities. In certain instances, the  
            election of directors may be uncontested, even after strict  
            adherence to the CID's Bylaws and Voting and Elections Rules  
            that involve numerous attempts to solicit nominees. In these  
            instances, AB 1799 allows CIDs the opportunity to save the  
            costs of a protracted and costly election process and seat a  
            new board of directors in a timely manner thereby making for a  
            more productive CID.

          CAI similarly states:

            AB 1799 allows these nonprofit HOAs to avoid the unnecessary  
            expense and effort of conducting elections when there are more  
            open seats for the board than candidates willing to fill them.  
             The bill also allows ample time for owners to self-nominate  
            or become write-in candidates.  On average, each [ballot]  
            packet costs more than $1.00.  In very large communities that  
            costs tens of thousands of dollars annually.  AB 1799 will  
            provide efficiency by avoiding spending funds unnecessarily  
            which can otherwise be redirected to neighborhood maintenance  
            and operational needs.

          As noted in the Background above, though most CIDs in California  
          are made up of 25 units or less, and therefore do not incur  
          large costs when conducting elections, this bill could help  
          defray costs for large associations.  However, it is unclear  
          whether, or how often, these larger associations would be in a  
          position to take advantage of this bill's cost savings  
          potential, given the larger candidate pool from which members  
          interested in standing for election are likely to emerge.

          <u> 2.Potential for candidate disenfranchisement </u> 

          The Center for California Homeowner Association Law (CCHAL),  
          joined by other groups in opposition, argues that this bill  
          could have the effect of insulating incumbent board members from  
          electoral pressure.  They argue that because the incumbent  







          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 9 of ? 


          members of a homeowner association board are in a position to  
          set voter and candidate qualifications under existing law, they  
          can use this power to disqualify opposing candidates and then  
          cancel elections for lack of sufficient candidates.  As stated  
          by CCHAL:

            AB 1799 gives boards a lethal combination of powers: it lets  
            incumbent boards cancel elections after they decide there are  
            enough candidates who meet the "qualification" rules created  
            by the board.  Homeowners also have to meet the board's  
            "qualifications" for voting.  This combination of powers  
            dis-enfranchises voters and violates homeowners' right to  
            self-governance, that is: to vote and to choose their own  
            leaders.

          CCHAL argues that a lack of specificity in existing law  
          pertaining to establishing qualifications for voting and for  
          candidacy in association elections has "led to extraordinary  
          abuses of power by boards in the ten years since the statutes  
          governing association elections were enacted."  They state:

            Boards have routinely established "qualifications" that have  
            nothing to do with a candidate's ability to perform as a board  
            director but whose real purpose is to prevent homeowners who  
            question board policies or decisions from running for a board  
            seat. . . . A Los Angeles County lawsuit brought by homeowners  
            illustrates the point vividly:  Griffing v. Village Palos  
            Verdes Homeowners Association.  In this case, the board  
            amended its bylaws to state that any homeowner who had sued  
            the board, its property manager, or another homeowner in the  
            last six years was not "qualified" to run for the board in the  
            upcoming election.  This "qualification" targeted a group of  
            homeowners, who sought association records detailing the  
            board's spending plan for a multi-million dollar special  
            assessment of $75,000 per unit.  The board ignored their  
            repeated written requests for the financial records.  [When]  
            the homeowners sued in small claims court to obtain the  
            board's spending [plan, the] board, in turn, amended its  
            bylaws to state that "any plaintiff?whether they prevail of  
            not in their suit may not, for a period of six years, declare  
            themselves a candidate for the board."  [The] 25 homeowners,  
            who had been seeking the records, sought an injunction in Los  
            Angeles Superior Court to stop the upcoming board election,  
            because the ballot did not contain the names of the  







          AB 1799 (Mayes)
          Page 10 of ? 


            homeowners, who had sued in small claims court and who now  
            wanted to run for a board seat. The court issued the  
            injunction.  It also ordered new elections with revised  
            ballots that that included the names of the dissenting  
            homeowners.

          CCHAL and other stakeholders opposed to this bill cite many  
          other examples of what they consider to be abusive homeowner  
          association actions to limit voter and candidate qualifications  
          in order to disenfranchise opponents.  Given the apparent lack  
          of clear standards prohibiting homeowner associations from  
          enacting election rules for the purpose of disenfranchising  
          others, the additional tool of being able to cancel supposedly  
          uncontested elections could further insulate incumbent board  
          members from electoral pressure.  As such, the policy question  
          presented by this bill is whether the Legislature ought to  
          empower homeowner associations to cancel elections in order to  
          reduce costs without simultaneously enacting appropriate  
          safeguards to ensure that qualification rules are not used to  
          inappropriately bar others from voting or running for elected  
          office.
